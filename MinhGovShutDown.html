						<h1 class="page-title">Federal Government Shutdown: Causes and Consequences</h1>	

                        <!-- Date & Author -->
						<ul class="entry-meta">

						</ul>						

                        <!-- First Paragraph -->
						<p>“Wait, so, I’m not getting paid? Until when?” was the same gut-wrenching line of question that civil servants echoed whenever a government shutdown occurred, or was it really? Initially viewed as administrative hiccups, Congressional budget funding disputes have scaled dramatically into a powerful political weapon. Any federal government shutdown over a prolonged period of time can not only force the hands of politicians, but also stall governance, often at the expense of millions of workers and public programs. But is the pipeline as simple as that? Is a government shutdown even legal in the first place? Actually, according to the Constitution, it is valid.</p> 

						<p>The legal mechanism for shutting down the federal government is rooted in Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution, which grants Congress the “power of the purse,” and is enforced by the Antideficiency Act (ADA). <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/the-antideficiency-act-explained/" target="_blank"> The ADA, prohibits federal agencies from obligating or spending funds before they are approved by Congress.</a> Chronologically, the first documented government shutdown occurred under President Gerald Ford in the 1960s, and at the time, a government shutdown meant Congress simply missed a funding deadline (whoops!). Employees kept on operating since executive agencies at the time interpreted that the ADA’s limitations did not apply during a shutdown. It was believed Congress still intended agencies to operate in the absence of appropriations and lawmakers would soon get it together.</p>
                    
                        <p>Continuing into the late 1970s (the years 1980-1981), however, <a href="https://time.com/5493596/government-shutdown-history/" target="_blank">the entire legal framework was clarified when President Jimmy Carter's Attorney General, Benjamin Civiletti, opined that the ADA requires agencies to suspend all non-essential operations during a lapse in appropriations.</a> This opinion set the modern standard, ensuring that when Congress fails to pass one or more of the 12 annual appropriations bills, which fund discretionary spending for agencies like the Department of Defense and the National Park Service, those agencies must legally shut down. This event might not seem that important, but due to Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti’s clarification (or “reinterpretation”) of the ADA, a funding gap turned into a very real shutdown that could visibly close federal parks, furlough workers, and cut services. <a href="https://govfacts.org/government/operations/government-shutdowns-explained-what-closes-what-stays-open-and-why/" target="_blank">The mechanism thus creates three distinct classes of federal workers during a funding lapse:</a></p>

                        <p>Exempt Employees: Those funded by permanent laws or independent revenue, such as the USPS or Social Security, who continue to work and get paid as normal.</p>
                        <p>Excepted Employees: Those deemed essential for emergencies that involve the safety of human life or the protection of property, i.e. law enforcement, air traffic controllers, and active-duty military. They continue working but do so without immediate pay.
                        <p>Furloughed (Nonexcepted) Employees: Those whose work is not deemed essential. They are legally prohibited from work, a status known as a non-pay, non-duty furlough.</p>

                        <p>But, that doesn’t explain why the most recent government shutdown spanned an entire 43 days duration. In retrospect, the weaponization of shutdowns entered as a slippery slope once partisan leaders started to utilize this to their advantage in policy fights. In the 1980s, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1995/11/11/us/looking-back-previous-government-shutdowns.html" target="_blank">President Ronald Reagan accepted short shutdowns over disputes with Congress about domestic spending, signaling that threatening a shutdown was a very legitimate bargaining tactic.</a> The idea became fully “weaponized” in 1995-1996 during the Clinton-Gingrich confrontations, when Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich deliberately allowed two long shutdowns. He did so by sending President Bill Clinton a <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/12/newt-gingrichs-1995-shutdown-came-fit-pique/578923/" target="_blank" >bill that ensues large spending cuts and environmental policy changes,</a> knowing he would veto it. Political science work often calls these years the start of modern <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brinkmanship.asp" target="_blank" >brinkmanship</a> shutdowns. (In another context, unions exemplify brinkmanship also).</p>

                        <p>As expected, shutdowns turned into hostage tactics between the Democrat and Republican parties in the twenty-first century. The 2013 shutdown centered on an effort by Republicans to defund or delay the Affordable Care Act, using the threat of a shutdown to try to win a policy outcome they could not get through normal lawmaking. Later fights did the same thing with the border-wall funding in 2018-2019, and, more recently, healthcare subsidies and benefit programs in the 2025 shutdown. In these cases, politicians treat the shutdown not as an operational mishap, but as a political tool to pressure concessions and reshape the budget. </p>

                        <p>The leverage has become painfully effective, as the lengthier and lengthier duration of modern shutdowns ensure economic tolls are more severe. Resulting from the 43-day shutdown, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was reduced by $18 billion in just the fourth quarter of 2025 alone.</p>

                        <p>Historically, financial markets demonstrate resilience, often bouncing back quickly once the government reopens, but this macro-level recovery offers little immediate relief to the severity of micro-economic damage. If the 2025 shutdown had lasted through Thanksgiving, an estimated 4.5 million civilian paychecks would have been withheld, totaling approximately $21 billion in wages. Military personnel, while protected by interim funding reallocations, faced the possibility of 4.2 million withheld paychecks in November, equating to $8.8 billion in wages.</p>

                        <p>Furthermore, the lack of federal activity slows the private sector. The shutdown prevented thousands of small businesses from securing federally backed loans, costing small businesses an average of $371 million a month in lost financing and revenue.</p>

                        <p>The most damaging and inequitable consequence of a shutdown is the uneven distribution of financial pain. While the Government Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019 guarantees back pay for furloughed and excepted federal employees, this certainty does not mitigate the immediate hardship of missing multiple paychecks. More critically, this guarantee does not extend to federal contractors, so the economic losses become permanent. Essential programs for vulnerable populations, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), are receiving delayed funding, leaving Americans in need without support. Over 42 million citizens, with approximately 92% of households below the federal poverty line, rely on SNAP funding, and 6 million Americans depend on LIHEAP to keep them warm and fed in the cold winter months.</p>

                        <p>Delays and closures for these programs leave vulnerable groups in immediate danger and instability. Furthermore, research indicates that Black Americans are disproportionately affected by shutdowns as they hold a greater percentage of the federal workforce than in the private sector. In states with higher numbers of civilian employees, such as Alaska, Virginia, and Washington D.C., the entire region can suffer economic disruptions during a shutdown.</p>

                        <p>From a missed deadline to a partisan bargaining chip capable of shutting the entire nation down, the Congressional budget now holds much higher stakes than it should. While the macroeconomy and financial markets may exhibit resilience and rebound, this offers little to no comfort for low-income communities and federal employees who shoulder the sustained burden.</p>
