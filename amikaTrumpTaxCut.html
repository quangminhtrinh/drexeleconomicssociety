                        <!-- First Paragraph -->
						<p>As the Trump administration takes power, significant changes in policy can be expected. From immigration laws to trade and international affairs, all areas and industries will be deeply impacted. One significant policy the Trump administration plans to implement is a reduction in the corporate income tax rate.</p>

                        <p>Previously, the most notable corporate tax reduction occurred in 2017 under the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/ES_20180608_tcja_summary_paper_final.pdf" target="_blank">Tax Cuts and Jobs Act</a> (TCJA), which slashed the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The purpose of this policy was to encourage companies to reinvest their profits into the U.S. economy, creating jobs, boosting wages, and spurring economic growth.</p>

                            <div class="post-thumb">

                        </div>

                        <p>In other words, the TCJA was enacted with the 'Trickle-down' effect in mind. The <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trickledowntheory.asp" target="_blank">Trickle-down theory</a> states that cutting taxes for the wealthy will create an incentive for them to spend and invest more which will eventually “trickle down” to the rest of the economy and increase productivity and wages. If businesses use their tax savings for research, infrastructure, and hiring, the wealth will flow to workers and consumers alike. While this seems foolproof in theory, the experience of the past several years suggests that the trickle-down effect may not work as smoothly in reality.</p>

                            <div class="post-thumb">

                        <p>In the short term, the tax cuts did have some positive results. Corporate profits surged, stock markets hit record highs, and some companies announced wage increases or bonuses for employees. This initially seemed to validate the policy’s claim as it appeared to create a ripple effect that benefited both businesses and their workers. However, in the long run the corporate tax cuts did little to spur sustained investment or dramatically increase GDP growth. According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, private nonresidential fixed investment (a key measure of business investment) grew by 6.3% in  2018 (the first full year after the TCJA) but then decelerated sharply to just 1.4% in 2019. This suggests that the tax cuts did not result in a sustained boost to business investment, as much of the initial tax savings were used for stock buybacks or dividends rather than reinvestment into the economy.</p>

                        <p>A major reason the promised outcome or the trickle-down theory failed to occur in the long term was because of how companies chose to allocate their newfound profits. Rather than reinvesting heavily in new projects, many businesses opted for stock buybacks and dividend payouts, actions that primarily benefited shareholders rather than workers.</p>

                        <p>The TCJA was set to expire in 2025. However, as President Trump returns to power, this is likely to be renewed as tax cuts remain one of his key economic proposals. This time, the corporate rate is expected to be cut again, going from 21% to 20% and to 15% for companies that make their product in America. While these cuts could lead to some short-term benefits, such as increased corporate profits and a boost to stock markets, there are several reasons to believe the long-term effects will mirror the results of the TCJA. Much like in 2017, businesses will likely use their tax savings for stock buybacks or dividend payouts rather than reinvestment into American workers and infrastructure. Factors like global trade tensions, automation, and shifting supply chains will also continue to influence corporate decisions on where to allocate capital, regardless of tax incentives.</p>

                        <p>In the end, the effectiveness of Trump’s proposed corporate tax cuts will depend on how companies respond to the policy changes. While the TCJA showed some short-term benefits, the long-term impacts were less dramatic than anticipated. It is important to think about whether these tax cuts result in a better economy or just deepen inequalities and widen the gap.</p>
