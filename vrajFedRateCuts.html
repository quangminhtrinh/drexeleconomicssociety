                        <!-- First Paragraph -->
						<p>In recent years, the United States' economy has seen significant changes. The Federal Reserve, commonly known as the “FED,” has reacted to these changes by adjusting the federal funds rate. In the FED's two most recent meetings, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/federal-reserve-cut-interest-rates-what-will-get-cheaper.html" target="_blank">September and November 2024,</a> they reduced the federal funds rate for the first time since March 2020 in response to decreasing inflation and an attempt to boost the economy. When rates are low, it incentivizes businesses and consumers to borrow money as they have lower interest payments. <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/08/interest-rate-affecting-consumers.asp#:~:text=The%20Fed%20lowers%20interest%20rates,sustainability%20of%20the%20economic%20expansion" target="_blank">Banks also typically lower their savings account annual percentage yield (APY),</a> which encourages consumers to put their money somewhere they will make a higher return. While the recent rate reduction is an encouraging sign, consumers are still left with many questions regarding inflation and mortgage rates.</p>

                        <h2>Mortgage Rates</h2>
						<p>Over the past two years, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/09/30/economy/housing-market-home-sales-redfin-report/index.html" target="_blank">home buyers have purchased homes at a much lower rate compared to 2020 and 2021.</a> A combination of skyrocketing housing prices and high mortgage rates have caused some to call it a crisis. Although many were hoping decreasing FED rates would provide the relief needed <a href="https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/despite-inventory-rise-home-buyers-remain-cautious" target="_blank">to get homebuyers into the market, buyers have remained resistant.</a> Mortgage rates have slightly decreased from 2023, but they have not followed the same downward trend as the FED's rate cuts. This is because mortgage rates are tied closely to the 10-Year Treasury Yield. It is important to note both are not the same as mortgage rates tend to be a little higher because mortgage lenders charge a fee.</p>

                        <h2>Inflation</h2>
						<p>Going back, the inflation crisis of 2022 started ramping up in mid-2021 and <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/publications/page-one-economics/2023/08/25/the-rise-and-fall-of-inflation-during-the-early-2020s" target="_blank">peaked in 2022.</a> Consumers felt the price increases in all aspects of their lives. Although inflation is still a concern for consumers and lawmakers, it has decreased from its peak in 2022. As a result of this cooling inflation, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/07/federal-reserve-cut-interest-rates-what-will-get-cheaper.html" target="_blank">the FED dropped rates first by 50 basis points and then 25 basis points.</a> For reference, 1 basis point is 0.01%, or another way to look at it is 100 basis points = 1%. When the FED decreases rates, it gives consumers more flexibility to borrow money as they save money on interest payments. As consumer borrowing increases, the US GDP will likely follow since <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/written-materials/2024/10/30/gdp-issue-brief/#:~:text=Consumer%20spending%2C%20which%20accounts%20for,also%20consistently%20beaten%20CBO%20forecasts." target="_blank">consumer spending accounts for over two-thirds of US GDP.</a></p>

                        <h2>New Administration</h2>
						<p>President-elect Trump has urged Fed chair Jerome Powell to lower interest rates. When reporters asked Powell if the impact on his proposed policies would play a role in how the Fed handles interest rates moving forward, Powell responded with, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/07/nx-s1-5180026/federal-reserve-inflation-interest-rates-trump" target="_blank">“We don't guess, we don't speculate, and we don't assume... We don't know what the timing and substance of any policy changes will be. We therefore don't know what the effects on the economy will be.”</a> Although Powell was first appointed by Trump, his handling of inflation and hiking interest rates has led to Trump criticizing him. The incoming administration's relationship with Powell is something to pay attention to when seeing how the Federal Reserve will go about future rate changes.</p>

                        <p>With 2024 wrapping up and President-elect Trump taking office in January, it will be interesting to see the changes that occur in the US economy. Consumers and investors must pay close attention to inflation, mortgage rates, and the incoming administration's economic policies, as these factors can shape economic opportunities and challenges in the coming months.</p>
