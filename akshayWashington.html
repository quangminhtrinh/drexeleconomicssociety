                        <p>A spiral of implications and rumors have spread on U.S.’s potential departure from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank due to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessant’s absence at the <a href="https://g20.org/#:~:text=and%20financial%20issues.-,The%20Group%20of%20Twenty%20(G20)%20is%20an%20international%20forum%20of,global%20economic%20and%20financial%20issues." target="_blank"> G20 meetings</a>. Many nations began to worry about the U.S.’s commitment to global integration as the new administration have already left the <a href="https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/01/1159211#:~:text=UN%20agencies%20responded%20on%20Tuesday,efforts%20to%20curb%20global%20warming." target="_blank"> Paris Climate Change agreement and WHO</a>. The IMF and World Bank could be next. </p> 

                        <p>President Trump has put Project 2025 into full effect since his inauguration. The new administration has incorporated the new federal program called “Project 2025” which explicitly states the U.S. to “withdraw from both the World Bank and the IMF” and to end its financial contributions. It seems that the new federal government is working to make this a reality. However, the Trump administration has released no official statement regarding this issue.</p>

                        <p>The IMF and the World Bank were created after World War II to prevent future wars and to encourage global integration. Headquartered in Washington D.C., the IMF is the last resort lender for countries in dire need of money. More than 90 countries rely on its aid and cannot survive without it, with <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/what-are-imf-world-bank-what-happens-if-us-pulls-support-2025-02-27/" target="_blank"> Argentina leading in outstanding credit ($31 billion) and can’t pay their government workers without it.</a> Its fiscal packages range from emergency cash to balance of payment during financial crises to the nation in need. These loans are dispatched in tranches, meaning the total loan amount is divided into portions and provided incrementally after meeting specific conditions, rather than being a single lump sum. This ensures nations resort to transparent budgets, cuts in wasteful spending, raising tax revenue and more. The World Bank lends loans at low rates to help undeveloped nations fund long term developmental projects such as healthcare, infrastructure, and energy. In 2024, the World Bank has disbursed a whopping <a href="https://financesone.worldbank.org/ibrd-ida-gross-disbursements-by-region/DS01237" target="_blank">$62 billion</a> in regions in South Asia, Latin America, Africa and more. This emphasizes the huge need for fiscal aid from developing countries.</p>

                        <p>The U.S. currently holds a quota of 17.4% of total contribution, making them the largest shareholder in the IMF. They also hold 15.83% share of the World Bank’s leading branch, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, making them the highest shareholder as well. Washington plays a major role in governing global economics thus solidifying its political presence. Additionally, the IMF indirectly benefits the U.S. economy by stabilizing key international partners that import American goods and services. Many multinational U.S. banks and corporations that operate overseas rely on IMF and World Bank financial data that allows them access to the markets and increased profitability. If Washington departs, many U.S. companies will lose their dominance in the global markets.</p>

                        <p>Not just the U.S. but other developed countries funding this institution have used it to employ diplomatic policies in their respective favor. If the U.S. withdraws, key players such as China can take a larger share and a greater sphere of influence in global economics. China currently holds 6.40% of the voting sharing and increased global lending through the <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/chinas-massive-belt-and-road-initiative" target="_blank"> Belt and Road Initiative</a>,  Chinese-led project to further global connectivity and influence through infrastructure loans to developing countries. According to Mark Sobel, former U.S. IMF board member, the U.S. departure “would be a major blow to their functioning, and it would only help China.”</p>

                        <p>Although the IMF aids foreign nations, its role in stabilizing international markets indirectly benefit the U.S. economy. Without Washington’s involvement, key trading partners such as Japan, Mexico, and Canada could face financial instability which then reduces demand for U.S. exports, thus lowering profitability. For example, many multinational companies such as Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, and more operate in IMF-backed nations. If there is economic disruption in these countries, then it could lead to lower profits for U.S. corporations. Moreover, big banks that trade overseas (Goldman Sachs, Citibank, JP Morgan, etc.…)  will not have access to global financial data. This hinders their ability to manage/trade foreign investments. In a sense, Washington’s absence will create a worldwide ripple effect, weakening U.S.’s global influence and allowing major players such as China to expand their dominance. </p>
                       
                        <p>The threat of U.S.’s departure from the IMF and World Bank is a global issue that will net a massive global chain reaction. There has been no official decision from Washington yet, but the outcome will affect economic stability in over 190 member countries in both programs. It will shape global financial policies for years to come.</p>
