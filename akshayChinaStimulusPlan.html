						<h1 class="page-title">Economic Stability or Financial Burden? China's Stimulus Package Unveiled</h1>

                        <!-- First Paragraph -->
						<p class="lead">As the world watched the reelection of President Trump, China braced itself for the incoming trade war. The new President has been clear about his tariff policies with China specifically, as part of his "America First" economic policy, to impose a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/26/trump-vows-an-additional-10percent-tariff-on-china-25percent-tariffs-on-canada-and-mexico.html" target="_blank">60% tariff on all Chinese goods</a> and up to 20% on all other imports. With a slow economy that has still yet to recover from the pandemic, China faces a new threat from the West. Tensions of a trade war escalate between the two nations and thus, the prospect has led to China focusing on stimulus plans to raise domestic demand to make up for the loss in exports.</p> 

						<p>In response, China quickly shifted the global market with their five-year 10 trillion-yuan ($1.40 trillion) debt package for 'hidden' debt swaps in local government. The term 'hidden' debt is used to describe loans, bonds, and shadow credits of local government financing vehicles. The stimulus plans included increasing the budget deficit to fund infrastructure projects, lowering interest rates, and eliminating certain reserve requirements to encourage lending. It aimed to boost domestic consumption as the pressure of the Trump tariffs looms in the future.</p>

                        <p>Despite these efforts, the debt package revealed pressing issues in the nation's economy. Over the past couple of years, China suffered high youth unemployment, low wages, and the net leave of household spending dropped to 20% lower than the global average. Citizens hoped this would be the big break. However, the fiscal package unveiled Friday disappointed investors who intended for the program to be a direct measure to boost domestic consumption in the economy.</p>

                        <p>As the nation entered its fourth quarter, the debt package offered some stability to the economy but failed to achieve significant growth. The increased spending created a substantial burden on the local government. These shortfalls have led to cuts in civil servants' pay and building debt with private sector companies, thus blocking money flows to the economy. This concept is perfectly summed up by Huang Xuefeng, a research director at Shanghai Anfang Private Fund CO, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-unveils-steps-tackle-hidden-debt-local-goverments-2024-11-08/" target="_blank">"The money is used to cover up hidden debts, which means it doesn't create new workflows, so the support to work is not that direct."</a></p>

                        </figure>

                        <p>This highlights the broader issue of 'hidden' debts connected to local government financing vehicles. According to  Finance Minister Lan Fo'an,<a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-unveils-steps-tackle-hidden-debt-local-goverments-2024-11-08/" target="_blank">the debt for these financing vehicles amounted to 60 trillion yuan by the end of 2023. That is 47.6% of the nation's GDP. Swapping these hidden debts is expected to save just 600 billion yuan in interest for local governments but it is far from sufficient for economic recovery.</a> Investors were disappointed because they had anticipated that the funding would directly drive domestic demand. However, the overwhelming debt limits the government's ability to focus on economic activities that foster growth in the economy. These activities include infrastructure development, support for smaller enterprises, and real estate stabilization. This difference between investors' expectations and the actual allocation of fiscal funds has led to discontent with the debt package.</p>

                        <p>All is not lost however as some are satisfied with the results of the debt package. Experts argue that the markets reacted based on short-term results. <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a897109d-8af2-480b-9138-4d8592078f2f" target="_blank">"The approach is more like a marathon than a sprint, focused on making the country's economic framework more durable and resilient,"</a> said Jianguang Shen, chief economist of JD Group. Shen argues that the package isn't a one-time cash check but a part of a long-term restructured program. He states that the debt isn't merely swapped with more debt but rather shifted into interest-bearing bonds, which will generate the local governments more fiscal money over time. These surplus funds can then be used to allocate outstanding payments, social services, and public investment. By catching up on local debt, the government can then provide durable framework for the economy in the years to come.</p>

                        <p>In summary, the 1.4 trillion-yuan debt package has potential to stabilize the economy for now, although it may not have reached everyone's expectations. One side, investors are disappointed with the results whereas other analysts are satisfied. Whichever perspective it is taken from, the nation is not in unity with their approval of the stimulus package. China still has much more plans in the future for their economy but for now, the stimulus holds mixed reactions for the nation as whole.</p>
