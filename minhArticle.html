						<h1 class="page-title">Worker Strikes on the Rise: Labor Unions in the States</h1>

                        <!-- First Paragraph -->
						<p class="lead">A resurgence in the presence and power of labor unions is sweeping across the United States after years of declining influence. It began with teacher strikes in 2018-19 and continued during the pandemic, involving various sectors, such as Amazon warehouse workers, Starbucks baristas, healthcare and education workers, manufacturing employees, and even railroad unions, with a noticeable uptick in strikes, organizing efforts, and worker protests in 2021-22.</p> 

						<p>What makes these labor actions particularly remarkable is the revival of union strength. The Writers Guild of America (WAG), representing over 11,000 members, and Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA), with 160,000 film and television actors, launched simultaneous strikes against Hollywood studios. This marked the first time both unions had gone on strike simultaneously since 1960, causing ongoing disruptions in the entertainment industry. [6] In the healthcare sector, a historic strike by more than 75,000 Kaiser Permanente workers is concluding with a new contract, combatting staffing shortages via substantial wage increases that will total 21% over the next four years.
						</p>

						

						<p>Overall, the 2023 labor landscape is undergoing rapid transformations, with 312 strikes involving approximately 453,000 workers, a significant increase from the 180 strikes involving 43,700 workers over the same period two years earlier. [2] These labor actions are not confined to high-profile industries. Smaller, lesser-known firms and contractors spanning across diverse worker groups are also joining the chain of American labor activism.</p>

                        

						<p>The resurgence in labor activism is not simply a modern phenomenon, as it connects back to earlier transformative periods in U.S. labor history. According to sociologist Larry W. Isaac, the first such period occurred during the late 19th century when a militant national labor movement emerged, battling against significant and bloody opposition from employers and state agents. [4] This was the forerunner to the National Labor Relation Act (NLRA) in 1935.
                        </p>

						

						<p>The second transformative period occurred during the Great Depression and the New Deal era, witnessing the revitalization of the labor movement, the emergence of industry-specific unions, and the transformation of labor relations through federal policies promoting collective bargaining. [4] The landmark National Labor Relation Act (NLRA), or Wagner Act, was one of these policies, signaling a critical milestone in the history of labor unions. The NLRA guaranteed workers the right to engage in collective bargaining and required employers to bargain in good faith with employee representatives. This legal framework provided the foundation for workers to form and join unions in negotiation of better compensation and conditions. [7]
                        </p>

						<p>The third transformative period emerged in the late 1960s and early 1970s when New Left movements (civil rights/Black liberation, antiwar, and women’s rights) spilled over into workplaces, revitalizing workplace activism, particularly in the public sector. [4] These historical milestones collectively illustrate the evolution of the American labor movement, driven by the need for workers to unite for their rights, improve their employment and job satisfaction.
                        </p>

						<p>The labor militancy surge against the backdrop of significant gaps, including (but not limited to) productivity/compensation, voice/representation, favorable public opinion but low level of union formation, makes it clear why worker strikes draw deserving attention from media, scholars, activists, and the public. [4] But what explains their increasing frequency? 
                        </p>

                        <p>COVID-19 undoubtedly served as one of the many catalysts for labor activism. The pandemic prompted employees to reevaluate their work-life balance and their relationships with employers. In addition, pandemic-driven disruptions in consumption led to record profits for tech companies like Amazon and Google, well-positioned to meet the needs of a quarantined society. This inevitably widened the gap between leaders and employees, as executive salaries rose while worker wages remained stagnant. [3] When the curve flattened, tech giants incited massive lay-offs in light of high inflation, falling corporate spending, and recession fears.  </p>
                        
                        <p>Thus, post-pandemic workers not only seek higher pay but also satisfaction and stability. Unions advocate for all that, aiding laborers to collectively improve both their compensation and quality of life through new contracts that mandate enhanced staffing, more time off and leaves, as well as safeguards against forced overtime. [3] Johnnie Kallas, a PhD candidate at Cornell’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, states that in unionized settings, many workers have negotiated their first contract since the beginning of the pandemic. This renewed focus on labor negotiations is occurring within a favorable environment marked by strong public support and a pro-union political landscape. A 2023 Gallup poll observed a notable 67% of Americans that believe unions benefit the U.S. economy.</p>                        
                        <p>This elevated public sentiment is further mirrored in the rising desire for unions to gain more power, with 34% of people expressing this sentiment today. [8] President Joe Biden, who has positioned himself as the "most pro-union president ever," has played a crucial role in this environment. He openly supported the PRO Act and revamped the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) via dismissing former President Donald Trump's appointees, which simplified the unionization process and sent a prominent message in support of labor unions.</p>


                        <p>As a result, striking workers are entering negotiations with a strengthened hand. Labor strikes now have a ripple effect, inspiring further worker activism and showing that the mere act of speaking up, whether successful or not, has the power to ignite lasting change.</p>
