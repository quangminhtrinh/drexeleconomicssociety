                        <p>While pressure keeps oil moving, it may soon send prices surging. Global markets are closely monitoring the new sanctions on Russia’s major oil exports to see whether they are tightening the valves on oil prices. On <a href="https://www.crowell.com/en/insights/client-alerts/key-takeaways-from-a-consequential-month-of-russia-related-sanctions#:~:text=U.S.%20Secondary%20Sanctions%20Threat:%20OFAC,business%20with%20Rosneft%20and%20Lukoil." target="_blank"> Wednesday October 22, 2025, the U.S Treasury’s Office of Foreign Asset Control (OFAC)  announced its levy of sanctions</a> on Russia’s major oil and gas producers, Rosneft and Lukoil, along with a dozen of its global subsidiaries. This was done in alignment with sanctions imposed by the U.K. a week earlier. Shortly after, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/?err=404" tagret="_blank"> the EU announced a ban on Russian Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) imports by the end of 2026.</a> Before the rollout of sanctions imposed on Rosneft and Lukoil, the U.S., U.K., and EU had been abstaining from taking actions due to their importance in the global energy markets. However, it seems that the urgent need for geopolitical changes has left Western powers no choice but to target these companies. While these political acts are relatively predictable, the market’s reaction remains uncertain.</p>

                        <p>Much of the pressure being applied to Russia’s big oil and gas producers, Rosneft and Lukoil, is intended to cripple the hands that fund the Kremlin’s war machine. Statements by the Treasury citing Russia’s <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0290#:~:text=lack%20of%20serious%20commitment%20to%20a%20peace%20process%20to%20end%20the%20war%20in%20Ukraine" target="_blank"> “lack of commitment to a peace process”</a> and “refusal to end” the war express Washington’s frustration with Moscow and its decisions to take action against Rosneft and Lukoil. U.S. sanctions (regulated by <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0290#:~:text=U.S.%20Department%20of%20the%20Treasury’s%20Office%20of%20Foreign%20Assets%20Control%20%28OFAC%29" target="_blank">OFAC</a>) against the oil producers hold complete restrictions on transactions between the U.S and the Russian oil producers.</p>
                       
                        <p>To date, three major restrictions define the U.S. sanctions: the first, U.S. persons or parties within the U.S. are <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0290#:~:text=all%20property%20and%20interests%20in%20property%20of%20the%20designated%20or%20blocked%20persons%20described%20above%20that%20are%20in%20the%20United%20States%20or%20in%20the%20possession%20or%20control%20of%20U.S.%20persons%20are%20blocked%20and%20must%20be%20reported%20to%20OFAC" target="_blank">prohibited from engaging in transactions involving Rosneft, Lukoil, and any of its properties</a>; second, <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0290#:~:text=any%20entities%20that%20are%20owned%2C%20directly%20or%20indirectly%2C%20individually%20or%20in%20the%20aggregate%2C%2050%20percent%20or%20more%20by%20one%20or%20more%20blocked%20persons%20are%20also%20blocked" target="_blank">Rosneft and Lukoil assets owned 50% or more in the U.S or by a U.S person are frozen</a>, and finally, U.S. financial institutions or others within the U.S. are <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sb0290#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20foreign%20financial%20institutions%20that%20conduct%20or%20facilitate%20significant%20transactions%20or%20provide%20any%20service%20involving%20Russia’s%20military%2Dindustrial%20base%2C%20including%20any%20persons%20blocked%20pursuant%20to%20E.O.%2014024%2C%20run%20the%20risk%20of%20being%20sanctioned%20by%20OFAC" target="_blank">prohibited from processing payments for any service involving Russia’s military industrial base.</a> Moreover, the U.S has warned of secondary sanctions — targeting buyers of crude oil from Russia’s big oil producers. However, with its biggest customers in Asia, the sanctions seem likely to have a significant impact on Asian markets.
                       
                        <p>Between Rosneft and Lukoil, <a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/energysource/how-the-new-us-sanctions-on-russian-oil-will-impact-energy-markets/#critical-questions:~:text=Between%20them%2C%20these%20companies%20export%203.1%20million%20barrels%20of%20oil%20per%20day" target="_blank">3.1 million barrels of crude oil</a> are exported daily, accounting for <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/23/china-india-us-russia-oil-sanctions-rosneft-lukoil.html#:~:text=of%20interactive%20chart.-,Rosneft%20and%20Lukoil%20together%20account%20for%20roughly%20half%20of%20Russia’s%20more%20than%204%20million%20barrels%20a%20day%20of%20crude%20exports,-%2C%20volumes%20that%20have" target="_blank">more than half of Russia’s total crude oil exports of over 4 million barrels per day.</a> Due to $60 price caps on Russian oil, formerly imposed by the West, many buyers in Asia flocked towards the discounted Russian oil, seeing it as an opportunity for huge profit margins.

                        <p>Despite the possibility of millions of barrels of oil being removed from the global market with no buyers, industry experts are confident that the sanctions will not cause immediate supply shocks. The rollout of these sanctions means buyers of Russian oil do so at the risk of losing access to the U.S. financial system, Western Insurance, and Western Shipping Services; however, the design of these sanctions doesn’t eliminate Russian oil from the market. Rather, it narrows its trading routes and potential buyers. These sanctions mean that Russia must use riskier payment routes, incur costlier shipping, and rely on non-Western insurance, among other caveats, which is exactly what the U.S. wants.</p>
        
                        <p>Alongside the announcement of sanctions in October, the U.S government set a November 21st deadline for winding down operations, which allows companies a month to wrap up existing deals they have with the Russian oil giants, Rosneft and Lukoil. This is meant to avoid an immediate frenzy in oil markets, while leaving a huge strain on Russia’s oil industry.</p>

                        <p>With direct and secondary sanctions at play, it seems China and India’s options may be limited to U.S. and OPEC supplies. Before Russian oil sanctions were announced in October, the U.S. had been imposing substantial strains on India’s energy trade with a <a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2025/11/the-impact-of-us-sanctions-and-tariffs-on-indias-russian-oil-imports?lang=en#_ftn1" target="_blank">25% duty on India’s Russian oil purchases and 25% reciprocal tariffs.</a> However, these targeted actions could potentially work in favor of both the U.S and India. Upon shifting crude oil demand, India could trade away higher-risk imports for more favorable trade agreements with the U.S., easing tensions and doubling down on the U.S.-India economic initiative,<a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2025/11/the-impact-of-us-sanctions-and-tariffs-on-indias-russian-oil-imports?lang=en#_ftn1" target="_blank">“Mission 500”, which is meant to increase bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030.</a></p>

                        <p>Following this, India’s largest importer of Russian crude oil, Reliance Industries, reduced orders from Rosneft and Lukoil by 13%, while increasing monthly imports from Iraq and Saudi Arabia from 26% to 40%. Moreover, state-controlled refineries, Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd., and HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd. have also announced their halt of shipments. These companies combined make up more than half of India’s purchases from Russia for the first half of 2025. This signifies India’s commitment to reaching better trade agreements with the U.S and its shift from Russian crude oil.</p>

                        <p>Similarly, China’s diversification efforts amidst secondary sanctions show Saudi Arabia, potentially replacing Russia as China’s top supplier of crude oil. According to Kpler, a leading global trade intelligence firm,<a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/posts/2025/11/the-impact-of-us-sanctions-and-tariffs-on-indias-russian-oil-imports?lang=en#_ftn1" target="_blank"> Russia saw a 36% decrease in imports</a> since the announcement of sanctions, with an almost equivalent increase in demand for Saudi Arabian oil. Figures show that <a href="https://agroreview.com/en/newsen/china-reduces-oil-imports-from/#:~:text=Maritime%20oil%20supplies%20from%20this%20country%20increased%20by%20345%2C000%20barrels%20per%20day%2C%20reaching%201.59%20million%20barrels." target="_blank">Chinese imports from Saudi Arabia reached 1.59 mbpd</a>(million barrels per day) in November, while <a href="https://agroreview.com/en/newsen/china-reduces-oil-imports-from/#:~:text=imports%20from%20Iran%20also%20demonstrated%20substantial%20growth%2C%20reaching%201.35%20million%20barrels%20per%20day" target="_blank">imports from Iran increased to 1.35 mbpd.</a></p>

                        <p>As the dust settles on the sanctions imposed on October 22, Russia's top clients are already changing global oil flows. China's major state oil corporations have halted purchases of seaborne Russian crude, while independent purchasers assess the dangers of secondary penalties and hunt for alternatives from the Middle East. India's refiners, which were formerly among the largest importers of discounted Russian barrels, are reducing spot purchases and are expected to diversify crude sources in order to protect refining margins and maintain market access.</p>
                        
                        <p>Despite these changes, it is not an easy exit. Traders and refiners in both nations are looking into indirect methods and non-sanctioned intermediaries to keep Russian oil flowing where possible, while Russia's pipeline deliveries, particularly to China, may be more stable due to energy security concerns and contractual obligations. The outcome is a gradual but significant reorientation of Asian crude demand: less Russian oil overall, more Middle Eastern grades, and a rebalancing of global pricing and supply dynamics that might have an impact on markets well into 2026.</p>
