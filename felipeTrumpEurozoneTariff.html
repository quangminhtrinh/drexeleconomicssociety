						<h1 class="page-title">From Slower Recovery to Swapping Bonds: How Does Trump's Tariffs Affect the Eurozone?</h1>

                        <!-- First Paragraph -->
						<p>Not even close to completing his first 100 days into his second mandate, United States President, Donald Trump, has already heavily imposed some of his tariff agenda, which happened not to be just campaign promises. Although the effects of this new policy have been widely discussed on the American economy these past few weeks, little has been said about its impact on the recovering Eurozone economy. Simultaneously, the pessimism over Trump's tariffs is slightly fading as <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-companies-swap-dollar-bonds-into-euros-lower-funding-costs-2025-02-20/" target="_blank">American companies are swapping dollar bonds</a> for euro, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/trump-tariffs-wont-easily-derail-euro-zone-recovery-says-klement-2025-02-17/" target="_blank">while the Eurozone's slow yet significant recovery seems unlikely to be heavily affected by new taxation.</a></p>
                        
                        <p>Since President Trump's inauguration, in January, the new American administration has adopted a fairly protectionist and wide taxation agenda. The main goals are, allegedly, to match the tax rates nations impose on American products and address the American trade imbalance, <a href="https://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/Press-Release/current_press_release/ft900.pdf" target="_blank">which reached $918.4 billion by the end of 2024.</a> In this regard, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tariffs-reciprocal-imports-tax-trade-economy-54c0a26687dc96157d96229068894720" target="_blank">a 25% tariff on all steel and aluminum imports and an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods have been imposed.</a> Moreover, the recently imposed taxes on historic trade partners, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/feb/11/european-leaders-vow-retaliation-trump-tariffs" target="_blank">Canada and Mexico, increased Eurozone governments' fear of tougher taxes on exports,</a> as the possibility of escalating tariffs on European goods became a major concern. This heightened uncertainty led  European governments to brace for potential trade shocks and look for ways to mitigate negative economic impacts.</p>

						<p>On the other hand, Europe has been indicating positive, while slow, economic indicators, meaning the continent might be overcoming its manufacturing sector struggles. Dragged by <a href="https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/investigation-economic-slowdown-euro-area" target="_blank">higher energy costs and a lack of demand from China, caused by Ukraine's War and Chinese</a> slowdown on consumption, the European manufacturing sector suffered multiple downturns in 2024. However, the Early Cycle Indicator, which historically signaled shifts in European GDP and Manufacturer's earnings, points to a recovery in the sector, as export orders slowly increased and annual GDP grew by 0.7% last year.</p>

                        <p>In contrast to other economies, such as China's and Brazil's, the EU economy might not be largely affected by the American's new tariff at first. <a href="https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/europe-middle-east/europe/european-union#:~:text=U.S.%20total%20goods%20trade%20with,($26.9%20billion)%20over%202023." target="_blank">Although the US holds a current good trade deficit of nearly $235.6 billion with the bloc</a> and investors are worried that new taxes might reignite Eurozone inflation and curtail its growth, the tariff imposed by Trump so far has little to no real impact on the bloc's outputs. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/trump-tariffs-wont-easily-derail-euro-zone-recovery-says-klement-2025-02-17/" target="_blank">The recently created 25% tax on foreign aluminum and steel, for instance, will not have a large impact on European exports, since this industry accounts for only 2% of total European exports.</a> As for the so-called “reciprocal tariffs” that the President recently signed, they will not be harshly felt by Europe's industry, since the EU's average tariff on US imports is only 0.9% higher than the tariff on European goods entering the US. The only sectors that might have to deal with higher barriers are automotive and food.</p>
                        
                        <p>This scenario does not mean, however, that Europe is fully protected against Trump's trade agenda. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/trump-tariffs-wont-easily-derail-euro-zone-recovery-says-klement-2025-02-17/" target="_blank">According to investment strategist Joachim Klement, although the currently imposed tariffs might just affect European GDP by roughly 0.02%,</a> if the American President follows through with his campaign promise of 20% blanket tariffs, the bloc can experience a drop in GDP growth of up to 0.9%, and inflation could rise by almost 0.2%.</p>

                        <p><a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-companies-swap-dollar-bonds-into-euros-lower-funding-costs-2025-02-20/" target="_blank">As these tariffs sparked higher rates of market volatility and raised concerns about being an inflationary policy leading to interruption in the easing of US rates by the FED,</a> American companies have been resorting to EUR/USD cross-currency swaps. By taking advantage of lower interest rates in EUR and the currency's lower value against the dollar, companies are exchanging the currency of their bonds to protect themselves from the volatility and macroeconomic uncertainty caused by Trump's taxation policy. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/us-companies-swap-dollar-bonds-into-euros-lower-funding-costs-2025-02-20/" target="_blank">According to data from Clarus, monthly EUR/USD cross-currency swaps jumped 7% in January, reaching $266 billion.</a></p>

                        <p>The whole globe finds itself in a cautious and anxious stage, while the uncertainties regarding the global economy's future grow as the Trump administration proceeds with its campaign promises. Although Europe might be struggling to recover from production losses and manufacturing demand problems, the slow but real European growth is not significantly impacted by the, so far, imposed changes in American trade policy, as many had feared. These factors do not mean that the EU is fully safe and out of Trump's action scope. Still, the economic indicators and US company movements towards currency swaps show a positive scenario for the bloc's future, at least when it comes to the new American government agenda.</p>
