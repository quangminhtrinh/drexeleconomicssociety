                        <!-- First Paragraph -->
						<p>As tensions rise in various armed geopolitical conflicts worldwide involving countries from the Middle East and Europe, analysts increasingly speculate and discuss possible spikes in gas prices in the media. The speculation is completely understandable <a href="https://fredblog.stlouisfed.org/2023/10/the-ukraine-wars-effects-on-us-commodity-prices/" target="_blank">since wars involving these regions eventually caused oil prices to blow up globally in the past, creating a commonly called “war premium price.”</a> However, oil prices remained affordable in 2024, even with the scale of the Israel and Ukraine wars.</p>

						<p>Recent economic data shows that in 18 of the 50 American states, gas prices <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/03/business/israel-iran-oil-price/index.html" target="_blank">remain under the barrier of $3 while the US Oil Barrel approaches its lowest mark within the year.</a> Despite receiving little to no media coverage, some crucial changes in the global oil market are contributing to more stable oil prices. Key factors include the boom in U.S. oil production, declining oil demand in China, and the surplus production capacity within OPEC+ (the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies). Together, these events have enhanced the market's ability to adapt during chaotic times.</p>

                        <p>During Biden's administration, the US managed to reach an all-time record in petroleum extraction, which helped the American market to protect itself from sudden supply shocks. <a href="https://www.energy.gov/fecm/hydraulic-fracturing-technology#:~:text=Hydraulic%20fracturing%20is%20a%20technique,oil%20or%20natural%20gas%20flow." target="_blank">By using a technology called “fracking”, where extractors input hydraulic resources into the soil to improve the flow of oil and gas underground,</a> the United States managed to build up its oil extraction exponentially. In the last decade, the US became the world's largest oil producer, pumping an <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/10/oil-market-shock-middle-east/680307/" target="_blank">average of 13 million barrels a day.</a> By extracting such oil amounts, the US economy not only managed to rebound from potential shortages caused by geopolitical conflicts but also demonstrated its ability to be an oil-independent country, leading the equilibrium price to a lower baseline.</p>

                        <p>Furthermore, China, one of the biggest consumers in the market, has seen lower oil demand rates each quarter, creating an increasing surplus in the global economy. The advent of new renewable energy generation and the boom in electric cars also caused <a href="https://www.energypolicy.columbia.edu/chinas-slowing-oil-demand-growth-is-likely-to-persist-and-could-impact-markets/#:~:text=January%E2%80%93September%202024.-,Between%202000%20and%202023%2C%20China%20accounted%20for%2050%20percent%20of,by%20far%20less%20in%202024." target="_blank">the demand for fuel in the world's second economy to decrease exponentially.</a> According to the Columbia University Energy Department, the Electric vehicle sales in the Oriental country reached 38% of total market sales last year, meaning a decreasing need for gasoline in the Chinese big market. Moreover, in 2024, <a href="https://e360.yale.edu/features/china-renewable-energy#:~:text=Renewables%20now%20account%20for%20half,is%20lagging%20behind%20installed%20capacity." target="_blank">renewable energy installations reached the mark of 50% of Chinese energy production capacity,</a> reinforcing a tendency of independence from oil in a billion consumers marketplace. Lowered demand for fossil fuels, when converged with a slowing economic growth rate in China, creates an environment of global oil surplus and, therefore, presses the prices to smaller marks.</p>

                        <p>Currently, OPEC+'s supply chain is experiencing idle capacity, cooling down market nerves. Founded in 1960, OPEC is a group formed by some of the main global oil producers that acts as a cartel combining prices and market supply to defend their profits. Since some of the cartel members, such as Iran and Russia, have seen the US and other oil-producer countries threaten their dominance and increase the market supply, <a href="https://energynews.pro/en/opec-extends-production-cut-to-stabilize-oil-prices/" target="_blank">the group decided to slow down extraction, cutting the production of almost 2 million barrels a day, aiming to maintain a higher oil global price.</a> Therefore, investors and governments remain optimistic: even if the conflict escalates, the global economy still can adapt to the imminent supply shock.</p>

                        <p>Although these changes in the global oil market might reduce OPEC's ability to use oil blockages as a geopolitical weapon, the global community must stay vigilant of inflation risks. According to the former White House Energy advisor Robert McNally, even though Iran might not be the biggest producer anymore, the Middle East is still the most important player in the oil market and the “heart of the global economy.”</p>

                        <p>Current economic data and market reactions do not necessarily indicate a spike in prices, but the geopolitical context is flashing warning signs. While there's no immediate reason for panic—oil prices have not surged dramatically during this conflict, as they have in past tensions—new market dynamics have made the Western world more resilient and less dependent on external oil supplies. However, underestimating Iran's and OPEC's influence on the global oil market and supply chains could mean overlooking the potential for a worst-case scenario. A supply shock caused by an escalation in attacks on Iran could lead to widespread hysteria if the situation deteriorates.</p>
