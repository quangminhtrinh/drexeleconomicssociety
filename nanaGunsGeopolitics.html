                        <!-- First Paragraph -->
                        <p>As tensions rise and events unravel, global powers are compelled to act in their best interest. Defense spending has always been on the grocery list, but now, more than ever, a shift in priorities has moved it higher up. <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/how-much-will-rising-defense-spending-boost-europes-economy#:~:text=Defense%20spending%20by%20European%20Union%20member%20states%20is%20set%20to%20increase%20significantly%20in%20the%20next%20two%20years" target="_blank">Members of the European Union are set to increase their defense spending significantly over the next two years,</a> while China has boldly pledged to increase its defense budget as well. These radical new steps are a reflection of US-ignited trade tensions and raging wars in Eastern Europe. While China's motives are indistinct, that of Europe's is clear. The EU's increase in spending is expected to have many effects; in large part, it is meant to improve Ukraine's survival after President Trump halted military aid and intelligence sharing. In the long run, however, it is expected to play a role in boosting Europe's 'sluggish' economy.</p>

                        <p>After a meeting on Thursday, 8th March 2025, 27 leaders of the EU committed to easing budget restrictions for <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-defense-ukraine-russia-us-military-spending-dbc6133a2412ec02adf87078f2f2f5cc" target="_blank">defense spending, funnelling some of the EU's unused funds toward security priorities, and providing 150 billion euros ($162 billion) in loans for military purchases.</a> This new scheme by the EU is an attempt to take the brakes off military spending and allow more room for economic growth. However, it is believed that an increase in defense spending will have a positive but constrained impact on the EU's GDP growth. Goldman Sachs' estimates suggest that additional spending on defense will have a <a href="https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/how-much-will-rising-defense-spending-boost-europes-economy#:~:text=fiscal%20multiplier%20of,by%20around%20%E2%82%AC50" target="_blank">fiscal multiplier of 0.5 over the next two years, meaning every €100 spent on defense would boost GDP by €50.</a> This projection is based on the assumption that imports of military supplies will decrease, driving up domestic supplies and infrastructure. Other macroeconomic research by the Kiel Institute for the World Economy suggests that <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=An+increase+of+defense+spending+from+just+under+2+percent+to+3.5+percent+of+GDP+would+cost+around+%E2%82%AC300+billion+annually%2C+Moritz+Schularick%2C+President+of+the+Kiel+Institute+for+the+World+Economy+says&oq=An+increase+of+defense+spending+from+just+under+2+percent+to+3.5+percent+of+GDP+would+cost+around+%E2%82%AC300+billion+annually%2C+Moritz+Schularick%2C+President+of+the+Kiel+Institute+for+the+World+Economy+says&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBBzQyNmowajeoAgCwAgA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#:~:text=E%20Ilzetzki%20%E2%80%94-,A%20conservative%20estimate%20is%20that%20the%20Europe%2Dwide%20GDP%20will%20grow%20by%200.9%25%20to%201.5%25%20if%20defense%20spending%20increases%20from%202%25%20to%203.5%25%20of%20GDP,-.%20This%20implies%20only">increasing current defense spending from 2.0% to 3.5% will result in GDP growth from 0.9% to 1.5%.</a> All in all, these incremental changes suggest that GDP grows by only so much.</p>

                        <p>To finance additional defense spending, the EU would have to issue more debt. Given the EU's Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stability-growth-pact.asp#:~:text=The%20SGP%20sets%20two%20hard%20limits%20on%20EU%20member%20states%3A%20a%20state%27s%20budget%20deficit%20cannot%20exceed%203%25%20of%20GDP%20and%20national%20debt%20cannot%20surpass%2060%25%20of%20GDP.">which requires countries to keep their budget deficit within 3% of their GDP and national debt within 60% of their GDP,</a> issuing debt would have proved a challenge. However, in response to the recent escalated attacks on Ukraine, the EU has called for an exception. The 27-member state union is looking to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/europe-defense-ukraine-russia-us-military-spending-dbc6133a2412ec02adf87078f2f2f5cc">free up €650 billion ($720 billion) in fiscal spending over a 4 year period, allowing each country to increase their defense budget to about 3% of their GDP.</a> With €150 billion in EU loans to Ukraine and €650 billion in fiscal spending, the EU is looking at mobilizing a total of €800 billion for defense-related investments.</p>

                        <p>China, on the other hand, <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/03/05/china-defense-spending-military-budget-us-trump-taiwan/" target="_blank"> has announced a 7.2% increase in defense spending for 2025, bringing its budget to roughly $246 billion.</a>  Much like the EU, the Chinese government is banking on the spending multiplier effect from the domestic production of weapons to give their GDP a boost. In fact, <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/03/05/china-defense-spending-military-budget-us-trump-taiwan/#:~:text=On%20Wednesday%2C%20Li%20announced%20that%20China%20aims%20to%20expand%20its%20economy%20by%20around%205%20percent%20this%20year—the%20same%20target%20as%20last%20year" target="_blank">they have maintained their GDP growth at 5%</a> despite heavy tariffs on exports by the US and are optimistic that defense spending will be a sure contributor to their economic growth. Aside from China’s ambitious outlook on economic growth, it seeks to increase defense spending for one other major reason: control over the chip industry.</p>

Under the cause of <a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/03/05/china-defense-spending-military-budget-us-trump-taiwan/#:~:text=“We%20will%20firmly%20advance%20the%20cause%20of%20China’s%20reunification%20and%20work%20with%20our%20fellow%20Chinese%20in%20Taiwan%20to%20realize%20the%20glorious%20cause%20of%20the%20rejuvenation%20of%20the%20Chinese%20nation%2C”%20Li%20said%20on%20Wednesday." target="_blank">China’s reunification”</a>, it has ramped up its military presence on the Taiwan straits to threaten the island. China’s long tension with Taiwan can be explained by their belief that the island is a breakaway province that will eventually be restored back to the Chinese State, but beyond a “reunion”, what China is really looking for is to have total control over Taiwan’s semiconductor supply chains.</p>
                        
                        <p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/19/taiwan-semiconductor-industry-booming#:~:text=Taiwan%20produces%20about%2090%25%20of%20the%20world’s%20most%20advanced%20semiconductors%2C%20mostly%20through%20the%20Taiwan%20Semiconductor%20Manufacturing%20Co%20Ltd%20%28TSMC%29%2C%20the%20world’s%20largest%20producer%20and%20a%20major%20Apple%20and%20Nvidia%20supplier." target="_blank">Taiwan, the largest producer of semiconductor technology in the world,</a> has been a direct investment target for the US during Biden’s administration. In a strategic move to leverage Taiwan’s resources, the US signed into law a <a href="https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/what-chips-act#:~:text=Defining%20the%20CHIPS,offshoring%20the%20technology." target="_blank">“Chips and Science Act”</a> that awarded large grants to chipmakers in the US. This act lured semiconductor manufacturers into the US, including a number of Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturers. However, with <a href="https://meidasnews.com/news/china-to-increase-defense-spending-by-7-2-in-2025#:~:text=Trump%27s%20call%20to%20repeal%20Biden%27s%20Chips%20%26%20Science%20Act%20Wednesday%2C%20designed%20to%20create%20U.S.%20semiconductor%20independence%20from%20Asia%2C%20could%20be%20disastrous" target="_blank">Trump’s plans to repeal Biden’s Chips and Science Act,</a> China sees an opportunity to access Taiwan’s supply of semiconductors. If China proceeds with its “reunification” efforts,  it may gain the advantage of controlling technological advancements throughout the century.</p>

                        <p>It is still too early to determine precisely how the recent surge in defense spending will play out for China and the EU. Nonetheless, certain facts remain clear: both the EU and China look to expand their influence via military spending, alongside a boost to their GDP. What differs in their approach is that the EU, through increased military spending, plans to ramp up its support for Ukraine against Russia. At the same time, China seeks to regain control over Taiwan and, indirectly, the semiconductor manufacturing scene. The broader implications of these efforts on economic stability and international relations are yet to unfold.</p>
