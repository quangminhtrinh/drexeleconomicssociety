                        <!-- First Paragraph -->
                        <p>President Donald Trump's executive order, issued on his first day in the Oval Office, has significantly impacted the U.S. offshore wind energy sector. The order indefinitely paused all leasing of federal waters for offshore wind and halted new or renewed approvals for onshore and offshore wind projects on federal land pending a comprehensive review of wind leases and permitting practices. Thus, jeopardizing proposed projects on the East Coast that could generate up to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/16/trumps-broadside-against-wind-industry-puts-projects-that-could-power-millions-of-homes-at-risk.html" target="_blank">32 gigawatts of power</a>—enough to supply electricity to over 12 million homes. This move has put a whole line of projects at risk, particularly in states like New York, New Jersey, and Virginia, which have ambitious clean energy goals.</p>

                        <p>The order, which has no specified end date, also suspended a large, previously approved project in Idaho. "We're not going to do the wind thing," Trump said during a rally after his inauguration on January 20th "Big, ugly windmills, they ruin your neighborhood."</p>

                        </div>

                        <p>On the same day, the <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2025/02/what-to-know-about-trumps-executive-order-on-wind-energy/" target="_blank">Department of the Interior issued a directive</a> for a 60-day suspension of "any onshore or offshore renewable energy authorization." Additionally, in a separate executive order, Trump declared a national energy emergency, citing the nation's "inadequate energy supply and infrastructure." While the order emphasized the need for a "reliable, diversified, and affordable supply of energy," it also blamed the previous administration for creating "a precariously inadequate and intermittent energy supply, and an increasingly unreliable grid." These claims echo Trump's long-standing, misleading criticisms of wind energy, which he has falsely labeled as unreliable and dependent on subsidies.</p>

                        <p>However, these claims have been <a href="https://www.factcheck.org/2016/06/trumps-hot-air-on-wind-energy/" target="_blank">fact-checked.</a> Electrical grids can manage the variability of wind power, and onshore wind—which encompasses the majority of U.S. wind turbines—is now cost-competitive with or cheaper than natural gas or coal plants. The executive order has significantly impacted the U.S. offshore wind energy sector, putting at risk proposed projects capable of generating up to 32 gigawatts of power—enough to supply electricity to over 12 million homes. States like New York, New Jersey, and Virginia, which have ambitious clean energy goals, are particularly affected. Offshore wind is seen as essential to achieving these states' climate targets, especially given the limited feasibility of solar power in the region. Offshore wind is seen as essential to achieving these states' climate targets, especially given the limited feasibility of solar power in the region.</p>

                        <p>The order has already had immediate effects. Two weeks after it was issued, New Jersey halted the Atlantic Shores offshore wind project, stating "uncertainty driven by federal actions and permitting" and Shell's withdrawal from the project.</p>

                        <p> Henrik Andersen, CEO of Vestas Wind Energy Systems, noted that the U.S. offshore wind industry has “come to a stop, more or less with immediate effect” following Trump's order. This setback comes after years of growth in wind energy, which now accounts for about 11% of total U.S. power generation and recently surpassed coal-fired power in output.</p>

                        <p>Overall, Trump's executive order has created significant uncertainty for the offshore wind industry, threatening clean energy goals, job creation, and energy security in several states. The long-term impact could delay the transition to a fossil-free energy future and increase reliance on natural gas, complicating efforts to combat climate change.</p>
